#Briefcase
###*Simple issue/case tracker*

## Concept

There are hundreds of perfectly decent issue trackers out there. Yet I am still making one for my own use... Why?

* Some of them are feature packed but complicated to learn/use
* Some aim to do too much, eg entire helpdesk rather than simple
* Some cost money, sometimes per user
* Some are just plain ugly
* Some of them are clean and simple but do not allow appropriate project groupings or workflow

* Some of them are probably *perfect*, but I don't know them


To be honest another main reason for this project is to have a simple project to learn a bit about rails, where I am the main user and therefore will perceive many requirements.
